Fourteenth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* When the user visits the site for the first time, they are presented with the homepage, navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard and the option to log in

* When the user clicks the homepage button, they are taken to the homepage which displays existing blog posts that include the post title and date

* When the user clicks on any other links in the navigation bar, they are prompted to sign up or sign in

* When the user opts to sign up, they are prompted to create a username and password

* When the user signs up, their credentials are saved and they are logged into the site

* When the user revisits the site at a later time and chooses then they are prompted to enter their username and password

* When the user is signed into the site, then they can see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard and an option to log out

* When the user clicks on an existing blog post, then they are presented with a post title, contents, post creator's username, and date created for that post with the option to leave a comment

* When the user enters a comment and submits, then the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator's username and the date created

* When the user clicks on the dashboard button, they are taken to the dashboard where they are presented with any blog posts they have created and the option to create a new blog post

* When the user clicks on the button to create a new blog post, then they are prompted to enter both a title and contents

* When the user clicks on the button to submit their post, then the title and contents are saved and they are taken back to an updated dashboard with their new blog post

* When the user clicks on one of their existing posts on the dashboard, then they are able to delete or update their post before being taken back to an updated dashboard

* When the user clicks the log out button, then they are signed out of the site

* When the user is idle for more than a set time, then they are still able to view posts but are prompted to log in again before they can add, update or delete.
